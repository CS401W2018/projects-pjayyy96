        <p>The Land Division is responsible for managing State-owned lands in ways that will promote the social, environmental and economic well-being of Hawaiiâ€™s people and for ensuring that these lands are used in accordance with the goals, policies and plans of the State. Lands that are not set aside for use by other government agencies come within the direct purview of the division. These lands are made available to the public through leases, licenses, grants of easement, rights-of-entry, month-to-month tenancies or kept as open space area.</p>

        <h2>question 1 :What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
            <p>This is a block or inline layer that works as a display on a page before any change are made.</p>
        <h2>question 2 :What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
            <p>The float tag is allowing the image to wrap around the text on move it to any area on a page, "clearing the float" is necessary because when elements float, they are importantly removed from the normal document flow.</p>
        <h2>question 3 :What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
            <p>This css tag is defining how elements appear on a wed page, including relative, obsolute, and fixed</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Relative : Allows objects to be placed in relation to one another. Leaves a blank space where the box resided when offsetting it from its flow.</li>
                <li>Obsolute : Allows elements to be placed on top of each other. Takes an element out of the normal flow of the page and puts it in a separate layer.</li>
                <li>Fixed : Keeps an element in its specified location even when the page scrolls. Takes an element out of the normal flow of the page and puts it in a separate layer.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>question 4 :How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
            <p>by focusing on keeping them simple, easily accessible, clearly labeled, appropriately sized, use intuitive icons where applicable.</p>
        <h2>question 5 :Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
            <p>In the home page link and the website w3school for learning more tags and uses of it.</p>
