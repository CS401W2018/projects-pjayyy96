                /date</p>
        <h2>5.How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
            <p>I will look up from the reference page and make me own word and comment the content, and it because i will make a movie review page i might need to check the image before i turn it into my page. I found that I could use a fair use, which mean all the movie review page can use a still image or a new article about a films, this is considering fair use.</p>
