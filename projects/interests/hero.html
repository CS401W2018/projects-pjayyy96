        <h2>The MCU hero | Black Panther</h2>
    <p>Black Panther is a superhero in Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he is "very much aware" of his responsibility as the leader of Wakanda. The story in the American Comic books has released long ago but the movie itself just came out in 2018s, the movie presented main characters in a very clear and entertaining way. The role of Black Panther bacame famed because of what he owns is incredibly powerful and unstoppable. His power and mindset are parts of what's interesting me, he always come up with plans and strategies to solve problems, and that inspires me to strive to be like him.</p>
