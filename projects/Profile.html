    <h2><u>Trail &amp; Hiking</u></h2>
<p>My initially hobby when I am free is go on a hike. I'm into nature and environment that surrounded by trees and plants, it makes me claim and builds a peace while am in the forest. Additional the make a hike more fun is to bring and friends and fellows that you just met, and invite them to go on a hike. It's a great idea to gain a better relationship between you and your new freinds.</p>
<p>Especially on Oahu, Hawaii. One of the Island in Hawaii state, and it has a lot of hills and mountains that allows people to trail and walk up to explore the beauty of nature, while exercising in the same time. Here are some of the hikes in Oahu that I'd recommend:</p>

    <li>Ehukai Pillbox</li>
    <li>Wailele Falls</li>
    <li>Koko head</li>
    <li>Kuli'ou'ou Ridge trail</li>
    <li>Lanikai Pillbox</li>
    <li>Pu'u O Hulu Trail Pink Pillbox</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My favorite quote about hiking:</strong></p>
